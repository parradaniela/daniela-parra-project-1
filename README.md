# Sanctuary Helpers

## Overview
This was a multi-page PSD Conversion project completed during Juno College of Technology's Web Development Bootcamp. The site is responsive across multiple screen sizes and accessible. Only a desktop design was provided in the original files, allowing me some room to get creative with the mobile styles!

The original design files can be viewed below:
